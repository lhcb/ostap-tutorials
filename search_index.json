use another name \n                  ('var2' , lambda s : s.pt/1000      )   , ## make some rescaling\n                  ('var3' , lambda s : atan2(s.y,s.x) ) ] , ## make more complicated calculations\n\nIf one wants to use other objects for 1-argument call, other set of accessor  functions   need to be supplied.\nE.g. if data  are expected to be supplied  as a tuple/list/std::vector, one   can use \nvariables     = [ ('var1' , lambda s : s[0] )   , ##

In this approach  data   are chopped into several categories and for  each category i TMV  is trained using the   remaing   N-1 categories, and the trained TMVA  is applied to the events from    category  i.\nTraining TMVA-chopper\nThe trainig-with-chopping is fairly trivial. First one need to define the number of distinct categories and the function to classify the events into training categories.  E.g. for TMVA training\ntSignal  = ... ## signal     TTree/TChain\ntBkg     = ... ## background TTree/TChain\n## book TMVA trainer     \nfrom Ostap.TMVAChopper import Trainer \ntrainer = Trainer (\n  N        = N                 , ## ATTENTION!

Arguments chop_signal and chop_background defined what sample (or both) to be chopped.  The    argument caterory described the integer-valued function, used for classification of events.  Actually trainer construct classification  function as category%N. \n How to choose chopping parameters?Click to expandFor efficient usage of events number of   categroeis shoudl be   rather large N>>2. For the given number of categories N, the   fraction of events used for TMVA training is (N-1)/N. Therefore with large N events are used more  efficiently.  From other side, for large N the traing time is proportional to N, while the  traing results shodul be more or less independent on N. It makes senseless  usage of N>100. Therefore one gets 2. In practice it is convinient to  choose 10. \nThe ideal classification function must be independent on the properties of  signal and or background. It should be pseudorandom and provide almost uniform population of categories. It is very easy to  achive using the following  expression  (Na*a+Nb*b+Nc*c+...+Nz*z+)%N, where a, b, ... , z are some integer-valued variables from the input TTree/TChain (event  number, run-number, GPS time in nanoseconds, number of  tracks in  event. number of hits in SPD, etc...), and Na, Nb, ..., Nz are prime numbers, that are large enough (Na>>N, Nb>>N, ... , Nz>>N).  With such construction, choosingN to be  also a prime number, one almost   guaranteed that  events are randomly  distributed into N-categories.\nThe category population can be  checked using setof  control historgams: \nbc =  trainer.background_categories \nsc =  trainer.signal_categories \nbc[0].Draw() ## show popultion of background categroies\nbc[1].Draw() ## the same with  different binning\n\nsc[0].Draw() ## show popultion of signal categroies\nsc[1].Draw() ## the same with  different binning\n\n\nUsing TMVA-chopper\nAgain one needs to define the classification function for input data.

The    created reader is used exactly in the same way as for no-chopping-case: \ntree = ... ##  the tree \nmlp  = reader['MLP']                     ## get  one method\nfor i in tree :                          ## loop over the entries \n    print 'MLP value is %s'  % mlp ( i ) ## get the  value\n\n For tests and debugClick to expandFor test and  debug purposes one can use it also  as a function:\nv1,  v2,  v3 = .... \nmlp  = reader['MLP']    ## get  one method \nfor i in range ( N ) :  ## loop over   categories \n    print 'MLP value for  categroy %s is %s'  % ( i , mlp ( i , v1 , v2 ,  v3 ) )\n\nAnd even get the difference between responces for different   categories.

Typical use-case is \n\none has set of data distributions \nand simulation does not describe these  distributions well, and one needs to reweight simulation to describe all distributions\n\nIt is relatively easy  procedure in Ostap,  however it requires some code writing.\nData and simulated distributions\nFirst, one needs to specify  data   distributions.   It can be done in form of 1D,2D and 3D histograms, or as 1,2, or 3-argument functions\nor even  all these techniques could be used together. It is important that these data distributions\nshould be strickly positive for the corresponding range of variables. E.g. in case of histograms, there should be no empty or negative bin content.  \nhdata_x = ROOT.TH1D ( ... )               ## e.g. use the histogram \nhdata_x = lambda x :  math.exp (-x/10 ) ) ## or use a function \n...\nhdata_y = ...\n\nSecond, for each  data distribution one needs to prebook the corresponding template histogram that will be filled from simulated sample. This template histogram should have the  same dimensionality (1,2,3) and  the corresponidg data distribtion. If data distribution is specified in a form of historgam, the edges of prebooked template histogram should correspond to  the edges of data distribution, but there is no requirements  for  binning. Binning could be arbtrary, provided that there are no empty bins.  \nhmc_x = ROOT.TH1D ( ... )\nhmc_y = ....\n\nIterations\nThird, one needs to create empty database where  the iterative weights are stored: \nimport Ostap.ZipShelve as DBASE \ndbname = 'weights.db'\nwith DBASE.open( dbname ,'c') as db : \n     pass\n\nSince Reweighting is  essentially  iterative procedure, we need to define some maximal number of iterations \niter_max =   10 \nfor iter in range(iter_max) : \n   ...\n\nWeighter object\nAnd for each  iteration we need to create weighting object, that reads the current weights  from database weight.db\nfrom Ostap.Reweighting import Weight  \nweightings = [\n    ##         accessor function    address indatabase    \n    Weight.Var ( lambda s : s.x  , 'x-reweight'  ) ,\n    ...  \n]    \nweighter   = Weight ( dbname , weightings )\n\n What is it?Click to expandThe accessor function is used to get the variable  from simulated sample. E.g. in this form, TTree/TChain/RooDataSet/RooArgSet can be used as source of simulated data.\nbut it could be also   e.g. some table, numpy array or any other  storage. In this case the  accessor function needs to be modified accordingly. The   second parameter specify the location in (newly created empty) database, where the current weights are to be taked from. Since the  newly created  database is empty, for the first iteration all weights are  trivial and equal to 1:\nmc_tree =  ...\nfor i in range(100): \n  mc_tree.GetEntry(i) \n  print ' weight for event %d is %s' % ( i , weighted (  mc_tree ) )  \n\n\nWeighted simulated sample\nAs the next step one needs to prepare simulated dataset, RooDataSet, that \n\ncontains all varables for reweighting \nthe  current values of weights, provided by weighter-object  above \n\nThere are many ways to achive this.

The  actual correction to the  weights is calculated according to the rule w = dd / mcd, where dd is a density for the data distribution and mcd is a density for simulated distribution. The weights w are calculated for each entry in array plots, they are properly normalized and stored in database dbname to be used for the next iteration. The   function makeWeights also print the statistic of normalized weights:\n# Ostap.Reweighting         INFO    Reweighting:           ``x-reweight'': mean/(min,max):        (1.00+-0.00)/(0.985,1.012) RMS:(0.74+-0.00)[%]\nThe last entries in this row summarize the statistics of corrections to the current weight. In this example, the mean correction is 1.00, the minimal correction is 0.985, the maximal correction is 1.012 and rms for corrections  is  0.74\\%. In tihs   example one sees that for this paricualr iteration th ecorrections  are  rather small, and probably one can stop iterations. Two parameters delta and minmax of makeWeights function allows to automatized th emakinnng the decison.  If calculated rms for all  corrections is less than specified delta parameter and for each correction minnmax-difference deos not exceeed the  specified minmax-parameter (the default value is 0.05), function return False (meaning no  more iterations are needed), otherwise it returns True. And using  this hint   one can stop iterations or go further:\nif not more and iter > 2 :\n    print  'No more iteratinos  are needed!'\n    break\n\nCompare data and simulated distributions for each iteration (optional)\nIn practice it is useful (and adviseable) to compare the data and simulated distributions at each iteration to hjave better control over the iteration process. One  can make   this   comparion using zillions of the ways, but for the most imnportant case in practice, where data  distribution is  specified in a form of histogram, there are some predefined utilities\n## prepare simulated distribution with current weights:\nmcds.project ( hmc_x , 'x' , 'weight' ) \n\n## compare the basic properties: mean, rms, skewness and kurtosis\nhdata_x.cmp_prnt ( hmc_x , 'DATA' , 'MC' , 'DATA(x) vs MC(x)' )\n\n## calculate the ``distance``:\ndist = hdata_x.cmp_dist ( hmc_x , density = True )\nprint \"DATA(x)-MC(x)  ``distance''        %s\" % dist \n\n## calculate the 'orthogonality'\ncost = hdata_x.cmp_cos  ( hmc_x , density = True )\nprint \"DATA(x)-MC(x)  ``orthogonality'' %s\" % cost \n\n## find the points of the maximal difference \nmn,mx = hdata_x.cmp_minmax ( hmc_x   , diff = lambda a,b : a/b , density = True )\nprint \"DATA*(x)/MC(x) ``min/max-distance''[%%] (%s)/(%s) at x=%.1f/%.1f\" % (\n        (100*mn[1]-100) , (100*mx[1]-100) , mn[0]  , mx[0] )\n\nUsing the result\nfrom Ostap.Reweighting import Weight  \nweightings = [\n    ##         accessor function    address indatabase    \n    Weight.Var ( lambda s : s.x  , 'x-reweight'  ) ,\n    ...  \n]    \nweighter = Weight ( dbname , weightings )\nmc_tree  =  ...\nfor i in range(100): \n  mc_tree.GetEntry(i) \n  print ' weight for event %d is %s' % ( i , weighted (  mc_tree ) )\n\nNote that due to explicit  specification of accessor function, reweighter can be customised to work with any type of input events/records. e/g/ assuem that  event is a plain array, \nand x-variable corresponds to index 0:\nfrom Ostap.Reweighting import Weight  \nweightings = [\n    ##         accessor function    address indatabase    \n    Weight.Var ( lambda s : s[0]  , 'x-reweight'  ) ,\n    ...  \n]    \nweighter = Weight ( dbname , weightings )\nmc_tree  =  ...\nfor event in  events : \n  print ' weight for event %s is %s' % ( event , weighted ( event ) )\n\n Abstract reweightingClick to expandAbstract reweighting\nDue to the freadom in choosing the accessor function, one can apply reweighting procedure to the absolutely abstract samples. E.g. consider the follwing case \n\ndata distribution : simple function \nsimulated sample  : random number generator \n\nAs a result of reweighting procedure, we'll get reweighted simulated sample, that  will be just a  random number generator, that produces  the weighted distribution  according to the specified function. For this case, the code is very transparent and compact:\n# =============================================================================\n## 1)  ``DATA distribution''  - plain function\ndef data ( x ) :\n    return 0.5 + math.sin ( x * math.pi )**2 \n# =============================================================================\n## 2) ``simulation template'' -  histogram template for simulated sample \nmc_hist = ROOT.TH1F ( 'hMC', '', 20 , 0 , 1  )\n# =============================================================================\ndef mc_sample () :\n    x = random.expovariate ( 1 )\n    while x  > 1  : x -=1\n    return x\n# =============================================================================\n## 3) create empty database with initial weights \n# =============================================================================\nimport Ostap.ZipShelve as DBASE\nif os.path.exists ( dbname ) : os.remove ( dbname )\nwith DBASE.open( dbname ,'c') as db : \n\nAnd then one starts iterations:\n# ============================================================================\n## 4) prepare reweigthing iterations\n# ===========================================================================\nfrom Ostap.Reweighting import Weight, makeWeights,  WeightingPlot\nfrom Ostap.Selectors   import SelectorWithVars, Variable   \nfor iter in range ( 100 ) :    \n    ##                                             accessor       address in DB    \n    weighter   = Weight( dbname ,  ( Weight.Var ( lambda x : x , 'x-reweight'  ) , ) ) \n\n    ## create ``weighted'' simulated  dataset using the current weights\n    selector = SelectorWithVars (\n        selection  = '1\nThe full example for abstract reweighting, is  accessible here\nThe density distribution for the simulated sample for before the first (blue open squares) and after the last (filled red points) iterations are shown here,  \nwhile the comparison of the initial data distribution (red line)   and the  reweighted simulated   sample (greed filled diamonods) are shown here. \n\n Why one needs iterations?Click to expandOne can argue that low-dimension reweigthing can be done withoky  iterations, just in one-go. Why one needs iterations here? \nThe answer is rather simple: yes for very simple  case, like 1D-reweigthing, already the first iteration  should provide the exact result. However it is true only if data dsitribution is suppleds and the historgam and the template for the simulated histogram has the same binning. Otherwise the differnt binning scheme results in non-exact result for 1-step reweighting.  \nFor multidimensional reweighting one can avoid iteration only if all innvolved variables are totally uncorrelated,  otherwise the iterative procedure is unavoidable. \nMoreover in the presense of correlations oscillation effect could occur, that prevents the quick convergency of the iterative procedure. To solve this problem, makeWeighted-function fior multidimensional case actually under-correct  the results.  It increases the number of nesessary iterations and make the reweighting procedure more slow, but itpractially eliminates the oscillation effect\n\nExamples\nSimple 1D-reweighting\nThe example of simple 1D-reweighting can be inspected here, while the reweigthing  result for the last iteration (blue  open squares) are compared with data distribution (red filled circled) here:  \nThe example also illustrates how to use various histogram comparison functions to have better control over the iterative process \nMore complicated case of non-factorizeable 2D-reweighting\nThe example of advanced 2D-reweighting can be inspected here.\nIn this example we have three data distributions fro two  variables \n  1  one-dimensional x-distribution with fine binninig\n  1  one-dimensional y-distribution with fine binninig\n  1  two-dimensional y:x-distribution with coarse binning\n\n\n\nIt reflects relatively frequent case of kinematic reweighting using the transverse momentum and rapidity. Typically one has enough events to make fine-binned one-dimensional reference distributions, but two-dimensional distributions  can be obtained only with relatively coarse binning  scheme.\nSimulated  sample is a simlpe 2D-uniform distribution. Note that the data distributions are non-factorizeable, and simple 1D-reweightings here is not enought.  In this example, for the first five iteration only 2D-reweighting y:x is applied, and then two 1D-reweighting x and y are added.  \nAfter the reweighting the simulated distributins are\n\nfor x-variable:  data distribution (red filled circled) vs simulated sample (blue open squares) \nfor y-variable: data distribution (green filled diamonds) vs simulated sample (orange filled swiss-crosses) \nfor y:x-variables  \n\n"},"tools/pidcalib.html":{"url":"tools/pidcalib.html","title":"PidCalib","keywords":"","body":""},"CONTRIBUTING.html":{"url":"CONTRIBUTING.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nostap-tutorials is an open source project,\nand we welcome contributions of all kinds:\n\nNew lessons;\nFixes to existing material;\nBug reports; and\nReviews of proposed changes.\n\nBy contributing,\nyou are agreeing that we may redistribute your work under\nthese licenses.\nYou also agree to abide by our\ncontributor code of conduct.\nGetting Started\n\nWe use the fork and pull model to manage changes.
